// Notes
- Mario gains up to 2 more blocks of rising time when his speed goes beyond the walking limit (such that he can clear 6 blocks at maximum speed)
- "Kicking" a grasped enemy while they are clipping inside of something solid causes them to die
- You can "ram" a grasped enemy into another enemy to defeat them in a "special" way.
- The enemy destroyed in this way has the same movement as Mario!
- Does not gain momentum when running up hills
- Mario only gains "momentum" when his speed is above the walking limit.
- If Mario is colliding with a wall, "momentum" will stop gaining.
- Mario enters "Full Momentum" if he jumps at full "momentum" with a tail. In this state, he can fly and will no longer deplete momentum.
- "Full Momentum" lasts for about 4~4.5 seconds and will not decrease unless the tail is lost.
- When "Full Momentum" ends, "momentum" is reduced to 0.
